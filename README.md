# Music Sheep
![logo](/build/icons/128x128.png)
Music Sheep is a music player built with electron, for playing your local music library.
The app allows you to change the playback rate of you music as you listen.

## Usage
To run the application, clone the repository and install dependencies with
```
npm install
```

When npm has installed all dependencies, run

```
npm start
```
to run the application.

## Compatibility
The app is built with electron, and as such _could_ run on Linux, macOS and Windows.
At this time however, I have only tested on Linux. Running on macOS _might_ work, and it probably won't work on Windows.

## License and Warranty
See LICENSE.md for the license. The app is licensed under MIT.
The app is developed purely as a hobby project, and as such gives no guaranties as to if or when bugs and vulnerabilities will be fixed. Use at your own risk!
